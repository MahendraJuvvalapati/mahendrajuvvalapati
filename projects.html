        <h3> <li><mark>POWER FLOW CONTROL OF A HYBRID MICROGRID USING MODIFIED UIPC.</mark></li></h3>
        <br>
        <font size="4px">
            a new approach for power flow control of interconnected ac–dc microgrids in 
            grid-connected hybrid microgrids based on implementing a modified unified 
            interphase power controller (UIPC). A typical grid-connected hybrid microgrid 
            including one ac microgrid and one dc microgrid is considered as studied 
            system. Instead of using the parallel-connected power converters, these 
            microgrids are interconnected using a modified UIPC. As the first contribution of 
            this paper, the conventional structure of UIPC, which uses three power 
            converters in each phase, is modified so that a reduced number of power 
            converters is implemented for power exchange control between ac and dc 
            microgrids.The modified structure includes one power converter in each phase,
            named as line power converter (LPC), and a power converter which regulates the
            DC bus voltage, named as bus power converter (BPC) here. The AC microgrid is connected
            to the main grid through the LPCs which their DC buses are linked and can operate in
            capacitance mode (CM) or inductance mode (IM). A fuzzy logic controller is used in
            the control structure of the LPCs. The fuzzy inference system is optimized based 
            on H∞ filtering method to reduce the errors in membership functions design. 
            Through the BPC, the DC voltage of LPCs is supplied by the DC microgrid. However, 
            since the DC microgrid voltage is provided here by a PV system, the DC link voltage           
            of the LPCs is fluctuating. Thus, as the second contribution, to stabilize the DC lin
            fluctuations, a new nonlinear disturbance observer based robust multiple-surface sliding mode 
            control (NDO-MS-SMC) strategy is presented for DC side control of the BPC. The simulation results 
            confirm the effectiveness of the proposed power flow control strategy of the improved UIPC for hybrid 
            microgrids.

        <font size="4px">
            Laser based Security System is a type of security and alarm system that uses
            laser light and a light sensor. A security system protects our homes, offices, banks, 
            lockers etc. from intrusion and unauthorised access. There are different types of security
            systems available and laser based security system is an important and efficient type.
            A Laser security system can acts as a standalone system, which makes some sound or noise
            when it detects any irregular activity, or can be part of a much bigger security and home 
            automation system, which can send messages, call the owner etc.

In this project, we have designed a simple DIY lased based security system, which acts as a tripwire like security system and triggers an alarm when the laser in interrupted.
